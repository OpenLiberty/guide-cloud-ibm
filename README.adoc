// =================================================================================================
// Introduction
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to deploy two microservices in Open Liberty containers to a {kube} cluster on IBM Cloud. 

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestrator that automates many tasks involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications. If you would like to learn more about Kubernetes, check out the https://openliberty.io/guides/kubernetes-intro.html[Deploying microservices to Kubernetes^] guide.

There are different cloud-based solutions for running your Kubernetes workloads. A cloud-based infrastructure enables you to focus on developing your microservices without worrying about low-level infrastructure details for deployment. Using a cloud helps you to easily scale and manage your microservices in a high-availability setup.

IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS) is part of IBM’s public cloud offerings. It provides a hosted Kubernetes cluster where you can deploy your microservices. You will use it with IBM Cloud Container Registry, a private registry used to store and distribute your container images.

The two microservices you will deploy are called `system` and `inventory`. The system microservice returns the JVM system properties of the running container. It also returns the pod’s name in the HTTP header, making replicas easy to distinguish from each other. The `inventory` microservice adds the properties from the `system` microservice to the inventory. This demonstrates how communication can be established between pods inside a cluster.

You will use Helm to deploy these microservices to IBM Cloud using Open Liberty Helm charts. Helm is a package manager for {kube}. It uses templates to generate {kube} yaml files and then deploys and manages them as releases in your cluster. 


// =================================================================================================
// Prerequisites
// =================================================================================================

== Additional prerequisites

Before you begin, the following additional tools need to be installed:

* *Docker:* You need a containerization software for building containers. {kube} supports various container types, but you will use Docker in this guide. For installation instructions, refer to the official https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker^] documentation.

* *kubectl:* You need the {kube} command-line tool `kubectl` to interact with your {kube} cluster. See the official https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl[Install and Set Up kubectl^] documentation for information about downloading and setting up `kubectl` on your platform.

* *Helm:* You will use the Helm Command Line Interface (CLI) to manage releases in your {kube} cluster. Download https://github.com/helm/helm/releases[Helm^] and see the official https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Installing Helm^] documentation for information about setting up `helm` on your platform.

* *IBM Cloud CLI:* You will use the IBM Cloud CLI to interact with IBM Cloud. To install the IBM Cloud CLI for your platform, run one of the following commands:

// =================================================================================================

== Creating a Kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud

Before you can deploy your microservices, you must create a {kube} cluster on IBM Cloud.

// =================================================================================================
// Configuring IBM Cloud CLI
// =================================================================================================

=== Configuring IBM Cloud CLI

Log in to IBM Cloud by using the `ibmcloud` command line. When you are prompted to select a region, choose us-south. This allows you to create a free cluster, which is limited to specific regions. Note that if you are using a federated user ID, you will have to use the `--sso` flag to get a one-time code for single sign-on.

[role=command]
```
ibmcloud login
```

// =================================================================================================
// Provisioning a cluster
// =================================================================================================

=== Provisioning a cluster

To create a {kube} cluster, you need `Administrator` access to IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. To confirm that you have `Administrator` access, navigate to the https://cloud.ibm.com/[IBM Cloud Dashboard^]. Then, navigate to `Manage > Access (IAM) > Users > [Your Username] > Access Policies` and confirm that `Administrator` is listed as a policy for all resources in the account or for the Kubernetes service.

Once you have confirmed that you have appropriate permissions, use the following command to provision a cluster.

[role=command]
```
ibmcloud ks cluster create classic --name guide-cluster
```

This command provisions a free cluster that expires in a month if you do not delete it.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
The 'flavor' flag was not specified. So a free cluster will be created.
Creating cluster...
OK
Cluster created with ID [cluster-id]
----

Check the current status of your cluster.

[role=command]
```
ibmcloud ks clusters
```

Wait until your cluster is in the `normal` state before proceeding. It will start off in the `deploying` state.

[role="no_copy"]
----
Name            ID                     State       Created          Workers   Location   Version       Resource Group Name   Provider

----

Next, it will transition to the `pending` state.

[role="no_copy"]
----
Name            ID                     State    Created          Workers   Location   Version       Resource Group Name   Provider

----

Finally, it will transition to the `normal` state. It may take a while for IKS to prepare your cluster.

[role="no_copy"]
----
Name            ID                     State    Created      Workers   Location   Version       Resource Group Name   Provider

----


Once your cluster is ready, connect `kubectl` to the cluster.

[role=command]
```
ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster guide-cluster
```

Verify that you're connected to the cluster by checking the cluster's nodes.

[role=command]
```
kubectl get nodes
```

== Deploying microservices to IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS)

In this section, you will learn how to deploy two microservices in Open Liberty containers to a {kube} cluster on IBM Cloud. You will build and containerize the `system` and `inventory` microservices, push them to a container registry, and then deploy them to your {kube} cluster. 

// =================================================================================================
// Building and containerizing the microservices
// =================================================================================================

=== Building and containerizing the microservices

The first step of deploying to {kube} is to build and containerize your microservices.

The starting Java project, which you can find in the `start` directory, is a multi-module Maven project. It's made up of the `system` and `inventory` microservices. Each microservice resides in its own directory, `start/system` and `start/inventory`. Each of these directories also contains a Dockerfile, which is necessary for building Docker images. If you're unfamiliar with Dockerfiles, check out the https://openliberty.io/guides/containerize.html[Containerizing Microservices^] guide.

To build these microservices, navigate to the `start` directory and run the following command:

[role=command]
```
mvn package
```

include::{common-includes}/ol-icr-full-docker-pull.adoc[]

Next, run the `docker build` commands to build container images for your application:
[role='command']
```
docker build -t system:1.0-SNAPSHOT system/.
docker build -t inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT inventory/.
```

The `-t` flag in the `docker build` command allows the Docker image to be labeled (tagged) in the `name[:tag]` format. The tag for an image describes the specific image version. If the optional `[:tag]` tag is not specified, the `latest` tag is created by default.

During the build, you'll see various Docker messages describing what images are being downloaded and built. When the build finishes, run the following command to list all local Docker images:

[role=command]
```
docker images
```

Verify that the `system:1.0-SNAPSHOT` and `inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT` images are listed among them, for example:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
REPOSITORY                                   TAG
system                                       1.0-SNAPSHOT
inventory                                    1.0-SNAPSHOT
icr.io/appcafe/open-liberty                  full-java11-openj9-ubi        
----

If you don't see the `system:1.0-SNAPSHOT` and `inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT` images, then check the Maven build log for any potential errors.

// =================================================================================================
// Pushing the images to a container registry
// =================================================================================================

=== Pushing the images to a container registry

Pushing the images to a registry enables the cluster to create pods by using your container images. It's a private repository so only users with access to your IBM Cloud account will have access to these images.

The registry you will use is called IBM Cloud Container Registry. Use the container registry plug-in to create a namespace for your container images. The namespace must be unique within IBM Cloud for the region you selected, so choose something relevant that you'll remember for the duration of the guide.

[role=command]
```
ibmcloud cr namespace-add [your-namespace]
```

Use the plug-in again to log in to the container registry.

[role=command]
```
ibmcloud cr login
```

// Tagging images
Next, tag your container images with the relevant data about your registry. Remember to replace `[your-namespace]` with the namespace you created earlier in the guide.

[role=command]
```
docker tag system:1.0-SNAPSHOT us.icr.io/[your-namespace]/system:1.0-SNAPSHOT
docker tag inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT us.icr.io/[your-namespace]/inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

// Pushing images
Finally, push your images to the registry. Remember to replace `[your-namespace]` with the namespace you created earlier in the guide.

[role=command]
```
docker push us.icr.io/[your-namespace]/system:1.0-SNAPSHOT
docker push us.icr.io/[your-namespace]/inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

// =================================================================================================
// Deploying the microservices
// =================================================================================================

=== Deploying the microservices

https://helm.sh/[Helm^] is a package manager for {kube}. It allows you to create a package called a chart. You can install a chart on your cluster as a release and then manage the release using Helm.

// Add repo
Add the `ibm-charts` repository to your local list of Helm repositories. Adding the repository allows you to use the `ibm-open-liberty` chart.

[role=command]
```
helm repo add ibm-charts https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/charts/master/repo/stable/
```

// Deploy to IKS
Use Helm to deploy the `system` microservice. Remember to replace `[your-namespace]` with the namespace you created earlier in the guide.

    --set service.targetPort=9080 \
    --set ssl.enabled=false \
    ibm-charts/ibm-open-liberty
```
--

After you run `helm install`, an output is displayed providing instructions on how to access your deployed microservices. Ignore these instructions for now, you will learn how to access your microservices in the next section.

The string literal after `helm install` specifies the release name, which must be unique. This is the name that Helm uses to identify this specific deployment of your chart. The following table gives an overview for each of the parameters specified using `--set`.

|===
| *Parameter* | *Description*
| `image.repository` | The name of your Docker image including registry/repository prefix
| `image.tag` | The tag for your Docker image
| `image.pullSecret` | The image pull secret, because the container registry is private
| `service.name` | The name of the service
| `service.port` | The port exposed by the service
| `service.targetPort` | The port exposed by the pod
| `ssl.enabled` | Specify if SSL is enabled
|===

Use the following command to find the status of the pods running the `system` and `inventory` microservices. Wait until the status of both microservices is `Running`.

[role=command]
```
kubectl get pods
```

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
inventory-app-ibm-open-l-5c586b9cfc-h5zmg   1/1       Running   0          23s
system-app-ibm-open-libe-84976bccfb-r22lj   1/1       Running   0          23s
----

=== Finding the microservice's IP address and ports

The service used to expose your deployments has a type of `NodePort`. This means you can access these services from outside of your cluster via a specific port. In this case, `nodePort` is not specified so the ports are randomized so you must obtain the ports before making requests to the services. You must also obtain the public IP address of your cluster. Note that there are other ways to expose your services such as using a `LoadBalancer` service type or using an `Ingress`. In production, you would most likely use an `Ingress`.

First, find the public IP address of your cluster.

[role=command]
```
ibmcloud ks workers --cluster guide-cluster
```

Take note of the `Public IP` in the command's output. This will be the hostname you substitute into commands later in this guide.

[role="no_copy"]
----
OK
ID                                                       Public IP         Private IP       Flavor   State    Status   Zone    Version   
kube-bpp5ge4f0ck66fue46vg-guidecluste-default-00000048   159.122.179.207   10.144.188.209   free     normal   Ready    mil01   1.16.8_1526 
----

Get the node port of the `system` microservice.

[role=command]
```
kubectl get service system-service -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}{'\n'}"
```

Get the node port of the `inventory` microservice.

[role=command]
```
kubectl get service inventory-service -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}{'\n'}"
```

Take note of the IP address and ports. They are required to make the HTTP requests.

=== Making requests to the microservices

To make a request to the `system` and `inventory` microservices,  `curl` or visit the following URLs to access your microservices, substituting the appropriate hostname and node ports:

* `{system-api}`
* `{inventory-api}/system-service`

The first URL returns system properties and the name of the pod in an HTTP header called `X-Pod-Name`. To view the header, you can use the `-I` option in the `curl` when making a request to `{system-api}`. The second URL adds properties from `system-service` to the inventory.

// =================================================================================================
// Testing microservices that are running on IBM Cloud
// =================================================================================================

== Testing microservices that are running on IBM Cloud

A few tests are included for you to test the basic functionality of the microservices. If a test failure occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code. To run the tests, wait for all pods to be in the ready state before proceeding further. The default properties that are defined in the `pom.xml` are:

[cols="15, 100", options="header"]
|===
| *Property*        | *Description*
| `cluster.ip`        | IP or hostname for your cluster
| `system.kube.service` | Name of the {kube} Service wrapping the `system` pods, `system-service` by default.
| `system.node.port`    | The NodePort of the {kube} Service `system-service`, 31000 by default.
| `inventory.node.port`    | The NodePort of the {kube} Service `inventory-service`, 32000 by default.
|===

Use the following command to run the integration tests against your cluster. Substitute 
`[hostname]`, `[system-node-port]` and `[inventory-node-port]` with the appropriate values.

[role=command]
```
mvn failsafe:integration-test -Dcluster.ip=[hostname] -Dsystem.node.port=[system-node-port] -Dinventory.node.port=[inventory-node-port]
```

If the tests pass, you'll see an output similar to the following for each service respectively:

== Deploying new version of system microservice

Optionally, you might want to make changes to your microservice and learn how to redeploy the updated version of your microservice. In this section, you will bump the version of the `system` microservice to `2.0-SNAPSHOT` and redeploy the new version of the microservice. You can redeploy a microservice using Helm to upgrade the release.

Use Maven to repackage your microservice:
[role=command]
```
mvn package
```

Next, build the new version of the container image as `2.0-SNAPSHOT`:
[role=command]
```
docker build -t system:2.0-SNAPSHOT system/.
```

Since you built a new image, it will have to be pushed to the repository again.

// Tagging images
Tag your container image with the relevant data about your registry.

[role=command]
```
docker tag system:2.0-SNAPSHOT us.icr.io/[your-namespace]/system:2.0-SNAPSHOT
```

// Pushing images
Push your image to the registry.

[role=command]
```
docker push us.icr.io/[your-namespace]/system:2.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Use Helm to redeploy the `system` microservice.

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

    --set service.targetPort=9080 \
    --set ssl.enabled=false \
    system-app ibm-charts/ibm-open-liberty
```
--

Use the following command to find the name of the pod that is running the `system` microservice.

[role=command]
```
kubectl get pods
```

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

system-app-ibm-open-libe-84976bccfb-r22lj   1/1       Running   0          23s
----

Observe that in this case the `system` microservice is running in the pod called `system-app-ibm-open-libe-84976bccfb-r22lj`. Substitute the name of your pod into the following command to see more details about the pod.

[role=command]
```
kubectl describe pod [pod-name]
```

View the events at the bottom of the command's output. Observe that the pod is using the new container image `system:2.0-SNAPSHOT`.

== Tearing down the environment

When you no longer need your deployed microservices, you can delete them with the following Helm commands:

[role=command]
```
helm uninstall system-app
helm uninstall inventory-app
```

Remove your images from your container registry.
[role=command]
```
ibmcloud cr image-rm us.icr.io/[your-namespace]/system:1.0-SNAPSHOT
ibmcloud cr image-rm us.icr.io/[your-namespace]/system:2.0-SNAPSHOT
ibmcloud cr image-rm us.icr.io/[your-namespace]/inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Remove the namespace you created in your container registry.

[role=command]
```
ibmcloud cr namespace-rm [your-namespace]
```

Log out of your container registry.

[role=command]
```
docker logout us.icr.io
docker logout registry.ng.bluemix.net
```

Remove your IKS cluster.

[role=command]
```
ibmcloud ks cluster rm --cluster guide-cluster
```

Log out of the `ibmcloud` command line tool.

[role=command]
```
ibmcloud logout
```
